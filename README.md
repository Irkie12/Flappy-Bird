For this code, I have followed the tutorial of KennyYipCoding, here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5ADM2uywg&t=2s
Although I have followed that, I have added other things such as mobile compatibility.
The controls are Space, Up arrow, X and for mobile devices you just tap on the screen.
